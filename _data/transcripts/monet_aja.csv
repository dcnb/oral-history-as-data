I am a graduate student at Northeastern, I am writing my dissertation right now, and my dissertation is on contemporary poetry and particular on how contemporary poets are looking into the past, the archive, oral histories, heritage, and things like that to make sense of chattel slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Looking at , Black history, Black diasporic history,  all over, but particularly in the Caribbean, and a little bit in the US.

[00:02:51],AP,"I don't know if that will be the case... (laughs). My first question is:  On YouTube, where I sourced a few of your talks, there is performance of yours in Paris at the Shakespeare & Company Bookshop and it was about you... you had been about to read the poem ""Language Frontiers"" and you talk a little bit about going to Cuba and a little bit more about your family heritage, and history, and language that inspired ""Language Frontiers."" And I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about that time in Cuba and sort of how you reflected on it once you came back.",Language; Writing Process; Cuba
[00:03:36],AM,"Yeah, well the first time I visited Cuba was for a grassroots poetry festival by an incredible young organizer in Miami, he goes by... I think his last name is Olivares, Elire is his first name, and he goes by El BÃºho, he runs a festival there called Caminos de Palabras, and there was, it was, really actually kind of interesting because I had come from visiting, or I was living abroad at the time, and I was really processing a lot, thinking about you know, I had been thinking about giving up doing poetry when I was living abroad and I had rekindled my relationship with it after a friend of mine encouraged me and saw a reading and was really supportive, and then I started thinking about coming back to the states, and I didn't know if it was going to be a good idea, because I really, at that point I really resented The States, you know, and the community there, and the way of life as an artist and as a poet. I think there is a big contention with American way of life. And so, while I was going through all of those things I got this incredible email from a poet that is actually from The US, his name is Bobby, he is the Poet Laureate of Colorado right now, Bobby LeFebre, and he said ""hey I want to connect you to this brother in Cuba, they love your work and want you to come for this festival."" And so, I then got this formal invitation. And this was really divine for me because I went to Sarah Lawrence College for undergrad, and one of the main factors of me going to that school was that they were the only school that I had heard of at that time that had a study abroad program in Cuba. But I never got to go, I never did an abroad program, because I was going through so much at home, and just a lot of things with family, and trying to maintain and keep my head above water with school. So, I never got to go, and I remember thinking 'wow this such a heartbreak of mine that I never got to experience this study abroad trip that I always envisioned in order to reconnect with my family history, and the roots, and things that I have been told.' And you know, Cuba has such a romantic, I think, you know, the image in American, especially young Black American, radical Americans, imagination. And I think there is this idea of the revolution, and what the revolution meant not just to Cubans, but to Black people in the states. And so that history was always there and present. You know I knew of Amiri Baraka's famous trip to Cuba in what it did for his consciousness, politics. I was very aware of the poets from Cuba, Jose Marti, and revolutionaries like Maceo, and you know, there is a history there that you know of, and you hear, that is kind of, shows up and is haunting you in a way. It's there, and especially if you are a young Black radical. So there is that, but there is another relationship that I have in that my family is from there and a lot of my upbringing, I grew up Black in Brooklyn, understanding myself as a young Black woman, but I always felt, a disconnect, or at least not fully understood in the Black community, because I had this cultural difference, of a Cuban cultural upbringing, or Caribbean really, because my grandma was Cuban, but my mother was also heavily influenced by her Jamaican roots, so we had a lot of Jamaican influence too. And so, all I knew of Cuba was my grandmother, and her house in Brooklyn, and her basement, and her relationship to Santeria, and you know in seeing people come and visit, you know travel all over the world to get information from her. And I knew that we had had family in Cuba, and that my family had this history and all these things she had fled from. It caused a lot of curiosity in our family because we had never, my grandmother never really talked about her past, and my grandfather had passed away when my mom was a child. So, we only knew that they had fled, and you know and like every family has these great myths of stuff that their grandparents went through or endured, the great myth was that my grandmother and my grand father fleeing Cuba in '61 on a boat a boat and putting my aunts and my uncles in a bassinet, and having to swim half way across the ocean-- it's like this whole dramatic visual. ANd so hear this story, this immigration story, of what it meant to come to America, so being in America was a very different thing [than] a Black person of the diaspora. When you grow up with that, your curiosities are even more deepened, because it's like ""why did they leave?"" and ""what did they leave?"" and I would hear all these things about what Cuba was, and what it meant. And so, I got this invitation and of course, I asked my grandmother-- 'where is family?,' 'what happening?' and 'do we have any people still there?' and she was very, you know, she was very vague you know, very vague. She mentioned that she might have a brother that was still there, but she doesn't know, she hadn't heard from him in years. And, you know, I started asking about her town, and what part of the country she was from and I knew she was from Guantanamo, I had heard a little about that story of her being from there and her being from there. So I knew a little so when I got to the festival I was like 'okay i am gonna go' but I also want to experience this, so I went a week earlier in order to go and try to learn about her and to try and find family. I was just curious, I think every Black person of the diaspora is curious about that question mark of where we come from, where did we get here, who are we, because we don't have lists, not many of us are fortunate enough to have a list naming back as far as great-grandparents, or great-great-grandparents. We don't all know that. So to me that curiosity was just the impetus of saying yes to this trip, figuring out a way to travel to see where she was from. I say that to say, all of those things colored so much of my writing. It is the little things that you experience that you don't realize stay with you over time-- the visuals, and sounds, and the tastes, and the people that you meet, and the energy that you receive. And for me, when I was there I learned alot about what the revolution cost, and what the revolution produced. You know?And, what the stakes were, and what was at stake for the revolution to continue, for them to continue to try and continue to support the revolution's legacy. So, I get there, and I find out that my grandmother had left four kids behind, and this was a huge thing. I mean, imagine me coming there and just talking to her a little less than two weeks ago, and she didn't tell me that she's got kids there. You know. There was this whole new confrontation of the personal being political. We say that, you know in certain ways, but as a Black woman I learned really clearly that my grandmother had... the stakes and what the cost of political decisions was to real families and real people.  We talk about things as they abstract, it is easy to talk about it like an abstract revolution, but what did it do to our family? How did our family have to move and navigate that, right? And so, you know, there was a lot to confront, a lot to process. When I got back I had this really huge, emotional, you know dramatic experience, and when I got back to Havana-- it was a sixteen-hour bus ride, it was this whole journey to get to Guantanamo, and how I found out about the family and found out about all these things. And then, I had to do this poetry festival. And process all that information-- and mind you, I didn't know Spanish very well. When I say I grew up Black American, I really did. I was closer, my mom raised us more Jamaican, with reggae and you know, Caribbean food, than she did-- she didn't speak Spanish in the house, or talk about... the only taste of spanish I ever got was from my grandmother, and even then she didn't really, speak Spanish to us. She spoke broken English mostly, and on occasion you would hear her 'buga buga' stuff or her magic with her people. Her ceremonial stuff that on occasion she would bring... we would hear spanish in the room. But it was really something that I was proficient in. So my struggle with language was understanding that we all, in addition to this, must have been affected by the years I spent abroad prior in France. So in learning about language is arrange all around the world, that as I started to immerse myself in other cultures, in other ways of articulating the world, I realized how important it was for us to communicate to understand-- 'well how are you arranging things?' 'How do you see?' 'What tools do you have to communicate the world around you?' 'what tools have you been given?' 'What words have you been shown?' and 'how do you, how does your culture deal with language?' And I think that in sitting through that festival and witnessing other people from other cultures and other countries was really important for me at that time, because I didn't have words for what I had felt in my heart. I still struggle to find those words with that specific experience. I am trying to write something about it now, in a memoir, and it's very difficult to find a way to describe the unlanguageable. To give language to the unlanguable. I think that's the struggle of a poet. I think that is a human struggle that we have as people. It's part of why...it is the impetus of why every moment of war or peace comes from how we communicate the unlanguagable. How do we deal with our frustrations around language? Around being seen and unheard. And, I think that for me, it was powerful for me to be in Cuba at that time, because I learned that language is a frontier, you know. It is so much of how we meet people on the shores of language. It's where we are introduced to the customs, and spiritual fortitude and expressions of people. I think that that was... it was an altering, life changing experience to say the least. It expanded my relationship to language and it made me have a real point of resentment towards the English language, and the limitations of English. Even the limitations of Spanish. Yeah, I told you I am long-winded, so I'll end there, but I think that I am still trying to understand what language means for me, especially as I am in a realm of working with sound now. There are other ways... and visual art too, so I think that there are other ways that I am learning the power of language, that is not just in words, but it's in the many ways we express the spirit.",Travel; Lnaguage; Writing Process; Emotion; Cuba; Politics
[00:17:25],AP,"Thanks for all of that. What I am really struck by is the similarity between us. So, my great-grandmother, who passed before I was even born, she was also afro-Cuban. I didn't really know much about that until I was maybe in my early teens, right before my grandmother passed. She's like 'you know, my mom, she was Cuban' and to me, I grew up very much Black American, not even with a lot of Caribbean influence at all, but she was like, 'yeah my father, when he was young, when he was in his teens, he had met a Cuban woman, who came to Miami and then move to Boston where my family is anchored now. I found that really fascinating, similar to what you expressed was a desire to learn more about family history. MY sister and I really, were really interested in this Cuban heritage but didn't have an outlet or person in our family to talk about it. And so we did... I think you described it as a 'romanticization' like 'oh what is Havana like, what is Cienfuegos... which is where my great-grandmother was from. And I also went to Cuba, I went to Cuba twice actually, I went by myself, or not by myself I went with my colleagues for an academic conference and I got back and I was like ""well, I don't know if I really experienced it, I didn't really leave Havana, and I was only there for three days."" And so my sister and I went back... and I don't know, I don't think the right word would be 'disappointment' by any means, but I think I was expecting something that wasn't quite there... or not 'not there' but, I think you phrased it much more beautifully than I did, they had this sort of longing for Cuba, and I had this imagination, and this sort of romanticization of Cuba, that when I got there, I was surprised in a way by how very American I felt when I had always imagined myself as kind of connected to this Cuban heritage. I guess I am saying that to think about how one connects to their own background and heritage. I was struck by a lot of what you said, because I would definitely align myself there, going to Cuba, trying to understand what is unspeakable, seeing faces that looked almost familiar to mine ro the people in my family. And wondering how we might have been intertwined in the past. But also, like the sort of material day to day life, and the impacts that radical politics have had on the country. Like, I don't know quite what to say...",Bonding; Cuba; Travel; Pedagogy; Blackness; Emotion
[00:21:03] ,AM,"Yeah, I know I recognize that. I don't know if you ever read Robin DG Kelly's Freedom Dreams.",Freedom; Politics
[00:21:13],AP,"No, I'll put that on my list.",
[00:21:14],AM,"Yeah, it's beautiful, I am actually in the process of trying to figure out a forward for it. He is reissuing it next year. But yeah, it's a book called Freedom Dreams, and it's [subtitle is] The Black Radical Imagination. One of the things he talks about, one for the first chapters, is about the dreams of the new land, and he has a part where he talks about the impulse for a marronage, and a desire to leave the place of oppression for a new land or some kind of peaceful coexistence. I think that that is a big part of... that is surely a big part of the Black America and the diasporas experience. I think that is for anybody that is dealing with deep oppression or hurt or trauma, our imaginations... what is capable within our imagination expands because of the gravity of what we are experiencing in our localized lives. You know? I think we start to really dream, and thinking up, and envision new ways of existing in the world... that is our attempt to transform our lived, material conditions. I think that is a big part of what you are speaking to, and what I was saying, in that Cuba has representation for many Black Americans as a kind of pilgrimage to a radical, revolutionary, uprising in the political imagination of Black people, that somehow, it in the same way, I would say Haiti conjures that for us... that it is a part of, a cultural lineage of our resistance in a way, the poetic narrative of these cultures is in the tradition of our resistance. IN some ways, they are homelands, they are the homelands of our resistance. We long to go to them, because we long to live in that state of this imagined liberation, in this imagined process of liberation, but I think what Cuba begs to question us is what happens in post-revolution. What is... I did a show after I came back from Cuba, and I have been trying to find footage of this. I did called ""Querida RevoluciÃ³n Soy Tu Nieta"" which translates to ""Dear Revolution, I Am Your Granddaughter."" It was my struggle with reckoning around what the revolution cost. The romanticization, having to face that romanticization that I created around the revolution, was really an illusion. Seeing Cuban people struggle, and seeing Cuban people in resistance. I think what was powerful for me was not to limit the Cuban, to not diminish the Cuban life, and to experience the struggle of living in the ways that there were materially. I think what often happens with the western tourist gaze is that we leave and we're like 'look they don't have, you know, the newest cars or jordans' but that is not freedom, that is not equality. Those aren't things that measure up when it comes to the heart and mind and spirit. That is metric of one quote~unquote 'metric American experience'  of civilization, it is based off of commodification of lives, and whether or not we have material goods, access to consumer goods has been the metric of freedom in American society for far too long. When you go to Cuba, you recognize that though, some of my family members do not have consumers goods that so we afford so much so to be around freedom, or our illusion to freedom, that they have something so much more quite profound than that... a sense of community, and culture, and pride, and purpose, and connection to spirit that I think has really transformed me. I don't want to leave that in a way that is romantic at all-- its very practical, literal thing. The people's quality of life there is far different. The values around literacy and health are far different, and the ways that Cuba has been strangled from the resources that it needs to continue to sustain that quality of life, or to make that quality of life even stronger, must be mentioned. We must mention colonialism and imperialism when it comes to Cuban post-revolution reality, but for me, it was really hard to have a political discussion when I am experiencing... or a political discussion in theory when I am experiencing the real life manifestations of the revolution and its impact on my family. ANd on this festival, to be clear. Because the festival had its own struggle to get poets there and just to exchange, for cultural exchanges... how much cuba has been siloed off from genuine cultural connection because of the political reality, and landscape of the government. And how much the Cuban people have suffered because of that, and their lack of exposure to the range and depth of other cultures and other creative expressions in the world... and it was clear that these organizers were hungry for that. Hungry for people who love poetry and spoken word and you know, hip hop, as much as they did. It didn't really matter to them, they weren't really concerned with the discussions of whether or not capitalism was this, or communism was that, I mean yes, the politics were important, but more than anything, these were people who were trying to organize around a niche art form that many people in their community hadn't fully experienced or understood. And so, how art was able to connect us in a way that transcended in many ways, or at least expanded the conversation around the politics at the time.  It was nuanced, it was a very complicated experience coming through this festival, and I think often artists and poets who travel  in that way, we see the intricacies of these systems, we see the fault lines and the cracks and the nooks and crannies of these systems and how it impacts people's lives, and the struggle for the people to resist that impact or to create in spite of that impact.",Politics; Blackness; Freedom; Language; Cuba; Travel;
[00:29:25],AP,"Wow, thank you. Listening to you talk, I, you know, in many ways still processing three years later. I definitely agree. Even just the sense of time, and how time moves... I know there has been so much attention to the capitalist relationship to time, where it's like this sort of rigid schedule or 'time is money' and I think that is one thing that I found really nice, maybe nice isn't the right word, it's sort of a plain word, but the nice thing about being in Cuba was that you just had time to do things. ANd people made time for you. Like I said, my sister and I showed up, and we didn't know anyone, we didn't even have... we had very little direction. But we would go and walk the MalecÃ³n and people would just talk, and they would say 'I have a nephew, he's in Dallas, Texas maybe if you go to Dallas you can find him.' To me that is not necessarily ridiculous, but it's just some random stranger who is 'like look up my nephew!' but it's amazing that he would make time and offer that connection to me. It was indicative of a culture that is so about meeting new people at this human level that does get thrown away when we are so focused on time as this limited, explicit timetable where you have to give it only to people that matter to you in some way or another. I am saying that because I am recognizing... You are helping me make sense of a lot of things I have been trying to think about with Cuba. I don't want to pivot too hard, but thinking about the shape of ""Language Frontiers"" I was curious about how you composed it, it's such an interesting composition. In writing it, I am interested in how it moves across the page. How it's... I have heard you read it... but how the poem takes up space. If you could speak a bit about that.",Cuba; Blackness; Emotion; Travel
[00:32:41],AM,"Yeah. I appreciate you for spending so much time closely reading with this work because it is something that I have, you know, I always wondered if people have paid attention to what I was doing. It is something where it kind of came to me-- do you actually mind if I read it again?",
[00:33:13],AP,Please!,
[00:33:22],AM,"Yeah, because I haven't had the time to revisit it before you asked, is that okay?",
[00:33:23],AP,"Yes, be my guest.",
[00:33:25],AM,"[Reads poem""Langauage Frontiers"" aloud in its entirety]. Yeah, this was such a favorite poem. Thank you for having me revisit this. So, the beginning of the poem begins clearly for me as speaking about voice-- the timbers and tones, and the nuances noises-- every sound has a song. And it is thinking about how we travel through the voice and how sound... how obscured this thing called language really is, you know. The fact that we do this thing is really quite bizarre. That we found a way to make meaning of sounds, sharing, I always found that so interesting. These are just sounds coming out of my mouth, and all they are is just sounds, and depending on your relationship to those sounds you know what I mean or you don't, depending on how you feel. I say that great listening is a poetic life... because at first the words on the page are all over the place because when your first relationship with words and language is like 'oh it's just a mix of sounds' and then you start to listen more deeply, and then the beginning of ones poetic life is that listening, that deep listening, and really starting to think for yourself, and understand for yourself and start to attend to who you are. And then I think the structure starts to come in. I think that there is this way of wanting to communicate and wanting to make things translate well about 'who are you?' 'Who have you learned yourself to be?' 'What have you learned about yourself?' How are you trying... How are you communicating who you truly are inside. I think a lot of where that structure comes from. You know, when I say metaphors are embodied practice, you know, what more of a metaphor do you need than what we do with language. In that, I think that we start to learn what we are doing when we do this thing called language... really it is remembering of what was, I feel. And a big part as you get to the end of the poem the poem starts to become more sparsed out, and in that way it is kind of a metaphor for the way that I think... As we start to come to our own end, our relationship to language becomes less structured, less rigid, less... you are not as concerned with, I think, being received in a certain way. Or, communicating a certain way... you become more ware of this predicament we have here called life, and you are not just you, and what speaks through you, what communicates through you is not just you, so you carry these nuances to these nuances in your relationship with language that comes before you. I think about that a lot, when I was young, I don't know where you grew up, but I grew up in New York City where we used to have, there used to be school fights sometimes and you'd walk down the street and there is a school that was around the corner... and you used to see Balck girls putting on hands, it is actually a really fascinating thing. You look at WorldStarHipHop and it's actually very sad, and heartbreaking, because what you are witnessing, or what I feel like I have witnessed is a people who have stripped of their language and of their cultures trying to communicate their frustrations with one another. The only way they have is through that rage they have towards what is really the inability to communicate. They take it on the people that are closest to them, the people that they love, and so we hurt each other as a means to truly try to be felt, and loved and understood. To find our language. It's a struggle to find our language. The ways we are broken from our language historically has kept us harming one another in ways that are irreparable, in ways that I think we are yet to truly comprehend as a people, and as a community. So I think part of what I am saying in that moment is that... our ancestors look at us from the borders of a lettered city across consonances we speak,  it goes back to that feeling of the unlanguable. And recognizing that we, I,  really had a real vision of ancestors at the borders of a lettered city, you know? And them trying to hug their loved ones across this border. If we were to be literal, we see all of these horrible images of immigration and all trying to be connected to their families and their loved ones. I would say that that happens on a physical level for us, but it also happens on a spiritual, and on a mental and emotional level for those of us that have been ripped away from our communities and our cultures and our customs and traditions. And so here we are, spiritually trying to connect those we love, trying to reach across these borders that have been put between us, and I think that is a big part of our struggle with language.",Language; Writing Process; Cuba; Travel; Politics
[00:41:49],AP,"Yeah, wow. Thank you. I loved so much about what you have said about not having a language. I think about like with those Black girls, a lack of language can be so misdirected and frustrating.",
[00:42:13],AM,"Yeah, it leads to you know, it is literally the beginning of war. It leads to... it really starts so much... If language is how you arrange the world, and most of the most cruel, corrupt ways of forming society is based off of a way of... literally a way of thought, of thinking, how someone thinks, is really [indicative] about how the world is set up. The systems reflect a way a culture thinks about its people, the way it thinks about the people most different from it. You know? And so, if we go to the language, the language is a really powerful and profound thing. If we are careless with it, it can lead to destruction, death, and war and oppression-- and it has, actually. I think the lack of tenderness, and consideration to truly understand and truly communicate with one another in languages that best express us and best define us is a big part of the greatest grievances in our society.",Langauge; Politics

[00:44:14],AM,Give me the other three I'll try to get to you.,
[00:44:15],AP,"Yeah, so I was thinking, the next two I can certainly combine, and if you need to head out that's fine. My attempt to combine these two questions, the first is about the research before you compose poetry, and the process of writing poetry, and how the words come to you. I am interested in whether you do interviews or visit archives or reach out to certain people. And then the second related question to that is... my project is about the afterlives of slavery, but I am also interested in gender, and women, and women in relationship to their children or kin. This sort of mother figure as a producer of both knowledge and human. I guess again, these two questions are really about how do you go about writing or researching your poetry before you compose it, but also, if you could speak a bit about lessons you have learned from maternal figures in your life or women in your life and how [that] has influenced you, or how you've learned from that, or them. Two big questions.",Mother; Blackness; Emotion; Writing Process; 
[00:45:59],AM,"I think when it comes to the process of creating a poem it is really about, attending to the self, making the time to find the words. But I also feel strongly-- and I know this is not very productive for capitalism-- but I feel strongly about the poetic life, and what it means to live poetry, and what it means to live a poem.I say that because for so much of my experience in the world, it is tried... so much of my relationship to poetry is about what I have embodied in my life, and in my way of life, and in my organizing, and the way I try to approach the things that I see in the community and conflicts I try to resolve within my question of community and my question of 'who set things up like this?'... How do we respond to things that are set up? How do we offer alternatives to how things are set up. I think that is poetry. I think how we resist, and how we find ways to free ourselves from language is actually part of my poetry. I say that to say, because if you are not aware of yourself and what you are here to do, you can get caught up in doing for the sake of doing. ANd the poem can be more about what you want to convey, than what wants to be conveyed to you, and what you are there to listen to, and what you are there to be, and be present for. I think that I come to poetry in many ways, but in many ways poetry comes to me. It chooses me on days when it is rather not convenient. When I rather be doing something else, or nothing at all. I find that poetry will bring you down and rattle you, and enrage you at times, and riddle you, and rhythm you, and rest you, it does so many things that truly make you feel alive. And I think that is why it is so profound,  and what it makes a life worth living that isn't deeply felt and grappled with. I think poetry has been a part of that for me. It is the state of being where one is truly timeful, you know? Present and timeful? ANd attentive to the timefulness of life, the fullness of it. I think that is part of where language and words have come to me. They'll kind of knock on the door of your subconscious and try and find your way into your mouth. ANd then maybe you can get them to your hands. You know, if you are lucky enough. But usually words come to me through sounds. I would say that a big part of my relationship to language has been through sound, and how the sounds of the words carry a certain frequency, a certain energy, a certain power about them, and they sit with you until you can't help but say them. ANd in order to say them again, you must write them down, and in order for others to say them you must write them down. I think that is where the writing for me is really... I see writing more as sheet music, I see writing more as notations for this process with sound. You know, finding ways to make sense of the sounds that are coming out of my mouth, and the sounds that are whispering into my ear. You know, the sounds that are carrying from the people I love around me, and the sounds I experience from those who struggled to love themselves, and to love those around them. So you know I mean words are really sounds, if you think about it. So I think my poetry is deeply engaged with the sounds of words. And, what the meaning that those sounds can produce when they fall on your ears in such a way. That as if, someone gave them to you with love, and with real care. And maybe that is why I read the poems the way that I do. It's not because I consider myself what some would call a spoken word artist or poet. I consider myself a poet-- I think poems are meant to be said, are meant to be sounds. They live in the internal vibrational pull of sounds. I think there is poetry in that, and in the relationship between sound and images, too. You know? There is a connection there. A lot of things come to me visually, you know... it is almost like synesthesia, when you see a sound or sound is an image, you know... it is really this cross wire of sense that [are] interconnected in a really janky way. It's kind of obscure and being on a really interesting psychedelic.",Mother; Blackness; Emotion; Writing Process; Senses;
[00:53:31],AP,"It sort of a synesthesia if you will, in the sense that the sense are crossed?",Senses;
[00:53:44],AM,"Yeah, I don't even know if they are crossed or if they are in harmony. They find their harmony together, they are an orchestra-- the poems orchestrate themselves in a way as to arrange the senses through sound... and I think that is a part of what they felt... is when a poem arranges sound in the form of words in a way that really... in a way that arranges your senses, that gives you words that give you a feeling. I think a poem orchestrates the words for that sensual experience, for that sensual...for being spiritual without being too kooky about it. I think it is a strange thing. I don't know that I have necessarily figured out my process as some other people have, I think I struggle to understand my process. Every day I am meeting myself anew. There are different parts of me that are finding ways to express themselves in the poetry that is life. I would say anyone that sits with themselves long enough to attend to the world deeply becomes a poet, sees the poetry of life, and the poem sees them, the poem finds them whenever they sit long enough with themselves, and with the world around them. I think the poem will come to them. But yeah, I don't know. My process shifts. Depending on how well I am attending to myself or the things that matter and the things I value in the world. I think it changes. And when you talk about mothers, about mothering, I would say that so many things have mothered me over the years. And there's that little birth, that I would not be without my mother, who bore me into this world, and she is such a powerful, incredible, profound human being, that I love so deeply, and I struggled to love and be loved by. I think that I, I think that we all have varying degrees of issues with our parents... there is no right way to do parenting, I think. But I do think there comes a time in one's life as a daughter where your parents become your siblings. Not in a sense of like 'oh we are equal' we are not equal, I don't think we are equal, but there becomes this solidarity between you. And I think siblinghood is about solidarity. I think I aspired in my life to have this sort of solidarity with my mother that could make life a little less of a struggle... When you are in solidarity with someone you feel less alone. You feel like whatever we are up against we are going to get through it no matter what. And that's it. And we are struggling to stand up for one another, and stand for one another and live with that sort of concern and compassion and I think that solidarity is really important for me in how I understand parenting. And what I have seen and witness from some of the parenting and mothering that I felt is strongest. Is that, you know... it's not this... I think sometimes mothers because they are so not cared for in society, that society has done a horrible job of demonstrating all facets of like, how motherhood is valuable to society, and how motherhood is valuable to the function of society... I think many mothers move in the world in a way that is a fight. It's a struggle to love, and live, and be loved and be cared for, and be valued, and appreciated, and even be comprehended completely. And yet, [they] are expected to continue to care and show up, and I think my mother resented that notion very much so. I think at this stage in my life I have compassion and solidarity with her, I understand how deeply her torment of struggling to raise kids by herself has made her resent the world and the conditions she was raised in... and in many ways resent us for even being born. And that's been my struggle, to forgive the predicament I was born into. To not, personalize and take it so personal when my mother expresses her hurt and harm. That is my continuous day-to-day struggle. But she is a very strong person who has dealt with so much, and that has made it difficult at times to be in each other's lives. And with that, I have learned to mother myself in many ways. I had to be the sister to myself I needed in many ways. And I looked for examples for myself of people who held the goodness I aspired to be. Examples of people who lived in ways I aspired to love and be loved and I gravitated towards that. I gravitated towards any woman who was willing to show me what love could do. Any man who was willing to show me what love could be in the world. I think I gravitated towards that, and it didn't matter the age, nationality, culture, I think I just... I aspired to love and I gravitated towards people who love deeply. And profoundly. And who just... uproot my whole notion of what love could be and I find myself fascinated by my own capacity to love in the times of complete difficult struggle, and I think mothers are a big part of how we learn that, you know? What does nurturing mean? I think there is a difference between caring for someone and nurturing someone and nourishing someone and supporting and showing up in solidarity. Care, I think, you can make sure that someone has their basic needs, but I think nurturing takes a little more tenderness, takes a little bit more... it is a specific kind of attention to the emotional, spiritual reality of a person to nurture someone. To see where they lack, what things they don't have vision for, or insight on and to [then] to fill those things. To teach someone how to fill those things for themselves. That really what I think motherhood is, that is incredible orchestration... you are equipping someone with skill sets and the powerful source... a reservoir of love needed to take themselves upon the world, to experience the world, to interact with the world at hand. And to know the difference between love and not love. To be able to assess that, make judgments accordingly, make moves accordingly. So I feel like mothering is a big part of not just my life, but of all life. I would say that the world would be a better place for a lot of things, but if there were more valuing and appreciating mothers I think the offspring and the children, and not just children born physically of mothers, but the many ways people mother... if they were appreciated more, our society would shift not just in but virtue of them being appreciated but by the act of us showing love back, showing love in return, of reciprocating that love... and that sense of nurturing, that sense of tenderness, kindness, thoughtfulness... poetic precision, poetic presence of those that show up for us. If we were able to offer that back I think we would start to see a real a shift, and a lot of mothers would heal a lot of hurt that they tend to bring to their children if that love is not there. My grandmother is a big influence on my life, my best friends have mothered me and become sisters to me in my life. I have gravitated towards certain mothers in my life. Wherever love is that is my mother. My mother is love. Whatever loves me mothers me. I would say fathers me too. Parents me too. Whatever loves me parents me. And I find that to be where I go, where I gravitate. It is towards that nurturing kind of love. Where sometimes fathering be a little bit more like... telling you about yourself or trying to get you into a structure, or preparing you for the practical things of life, and the politics... I think it is the marriage of.. When you have a good parenting relationship it's the marriage of the personal is political. You know? I think that is a real good, a marriage is a good balance of energy, a balance of understanding the interdependence of things in life. That life has... the butterfly effect that we all impact each other, when we all when we do that harmonious thing of recognizing each other as gifts. Allowing each other to be fully present in our gifts, then it produces this really profound, creative, outcome. I think that human beings deserve more of that interdependent raising, that nurturing upbring that really merges and marries that personal, political reality where the spiritual, emotional, and the physical, and the mental are in unison with another and neither is more valued than the other. Every part has a relevance.",Writing Process; Emotion; Senses; 
[01:06:45],AP,"Yeah, I mean... I agree. I am really struck by so much of what you've said, and I am trying to take some notes and process at the same time. I definitely agree. One of the ideas that runs throughout my scholarship is the idea of how in the afterlife, or the wake, of slavery it has shifted how we think about kinship and relationships. Your reflections here have been helpful to build on that... on making sense of it. Thank you. This next question, in many ways you have gotten us to this point, but I am just going to ask: In another lecture that you gave on the legacy of June Jordan you talk about freedom and poetry, and of course 'poetry is how we get free.' And so, I guess this question... I want to ask about poetry as a reader of poems, and if making poetry is making us free is reading poetry in a way... when you were speaking I was thinking of Toni Morrison who says 'the function of freedom is to free somebody else' and so, I guess seeing this, I was thinking about how poetry is freeing for yourself but how reading other people's poetry is freeing experience. And what you hope your readers get out of your own poetry.",Bonding; Writing Process; Freedom
[01:09:11],AM,"Yeah, I mean, I don't know if I necessarily see it as one way or the other. But, I think freedom... Well, you said a few things there. You said something about Toni Morrison, but can you rephrase the question part prior to Toni Morrison.",Freedom; 
[01:09:37],AP,"Yeah, sorry, I was trying to do too much. The first question was, I was wondering if you could speak a bit about poetry as a reader of poetry...if writing poetry is what makes us free is it possible that reading poetry can also make us free?",
[01:10:01],AM,"Oh yeah, I think reading poetry and poetry is no different. I think... I mean it's different but it is equally valuable, important, and transformative. I think for me, freedom comes from recognizing freedom is not a place, not a destination, it's not a thing, it's not a piece, or a play... It's one's own experience with the divine, and the divine presence, and part of my relationship to understanding that freedom is not some elusive, lofty, ideal, but it is an engaged practice that we commit to in our hearts and minds. It is the capacity to imagine, the capacity to dream. It is our relationship to vision and it is our relationship to one another. I think freedom is knowing that... the way that I describe it is that freedom can't be given or taken. It is, or isn't. It is, or it aint.  ANd, it is something that you have to be. It is a way of being, it is a way off... yeah indgenous people could have land taken from them, or we could have our lives taken from us but that's not... having land, or even having the audacity... the arrogance around living even that, to me, is not freedom. What I find most profound about Black people, and I have said this before and I have written this before, is that--I know people can think what they want about this saying-- I have said before, Black people, we death for breakfast. You know, on a tuesday. What is death to us? You want me to be scared of death? Death is nothing to be afraid of... I have a poem that is like 'we meet kin there.' Death is where we return to a long standing tradition of ourselves. I think whiteness and colonization has been very obsessed with immortality. But Black people, we have never been concerned with living forever. We know that living is not determined based of off this existence, this matrix that we have created here together. You know? Living is far more profound than that. I think that is freedom. Freedom is knowing that, freedom is a way of being. Freedom is being. It being, existing, never allowing anyone to take being from you or to give you being. To know that someone's connection to a land or their body is really a limited view of their existence here, it is a limited view of why were are here together. It is unfortunate, it is so sad that man and the world has... that society, the western society, has conditioned people to live in what I would say is a state of of mental and spiraitual slavery. And in thinking that the greatest illusion of freedom is to be able to consume, to be able to have every type of car you want, to have every type of food you can eat, to have any type of house you can live in. We have equated freedom to be a strictly material condition. I think that is the saddest part of how we have talked about freedom, but I would say some of the freest people that we were able to learn about, some of the freest people we know are people who are locked up behind bars. Who are living in grave conditions in the West Bank in Palestine, who are fighting and liberating, and in young women's bodies and minds in the Congo, who are migrating from horrible conditions in Haiti post... earth disasters, like natural disasters. We have people who experienced such grave experiences in life that they understand that this isn't all there is. That this existence that we have, is what makes up the meaning of life, and the purpose of why we are here to acquire and attain more things... that that is the way we are taught for freedom to exist. I think poetry comes through the struggle, poetry comes through the resistance, poetry comes through recognizing that the resistance is freedom... that the act of actually standing up for yourself is freedom. The moment that Harriet Tubman decided to get a rifle and tell people we are going up is freedom. That is the freedom. We thought she was... my friend said... we tell this story that she was running for freedom, but the fact that she ran, that was the freedom. It wasn't a destination or a land she was running to, she was the freedom. She had freedom. And that is the poem to me. It is not a place that you are gonna get when you read a poem or write a poem, but it is the actual being and recognizing the poem that is the actual freedom. It is the doing, and the experiencing, and the sharing of the poem that is the freedom. It is that way of going, that way of experiencing the timelessness and the timefulness of an incredible live jazz performance, that is freedom. The complete expression and awareness of self and power, is to me, a freedom. And the sharing of that, the solidarity of that awareness and that presence is the freedom. I think that as we start to see poetry as more than just the words on a page, but [instead] that shared presence, or that shared awareness of resistance and struggle and joy. Then we start to become the poem, we become the freedom. Honestly, I think we are born free. We born and we die free. It is up to us whether or not we give that away.",Writing Process; Emotion; Freedom;
